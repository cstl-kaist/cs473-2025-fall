## What do I do?
You'll need to find teammates to work on your social computing project this semester. Each team should have three people by default. There may need to be a small number of four-person teams.

## How do I find teammates?

Here are three methods you can use:

- You can use Campuswire to post advertisements for finding teammates. Please use the "Team Formation" category when posting.
- We'll give 10 minutes at the end of two classes for in-person team formation.
- Use office hours to talk to us about project ideas so that we can make connections, and you can also run into other classmates.

Please try to have diversity in your own team: skillset, interests, and background.

## Okay, we have a team now. How do we submit?
Each team needs to submit the [team signup form](https://forms.gle/kEmLdrDp7CQ7YYvcA). Note that your team just needs to submit once; no need for everyone to submit the form separately.
