## What do I do?
Once a semester as part of a group, you'll lead a class section for **25 minutes**. This means you'll present in front of the class, show examples, run activities, ask and answer questions, and facilitate class discussion. Here are the three steps that are involved:
* Share your lesson plan with the course staff and get feedback. This is a written document (maximum one page) that needs to be sent to the course staff.
* Read the pre-class material thoroughly (all readings for that topic).
* Submit your presentation material and activity document after your presentation.

Your presentation should include the following:
* Present a few real-life examples that represent the topics covered in the pre-class material and connect them to social computing. Explain what the examples are about, why they matter, and what the implications are. Feel free to promote student discussion regarding the examples.
* Design and run an in-class activity, which should ask students to analyze, design, make, or present something.

Key in your activity design is to include **interactive components**, such as a short design exercise, a simulated crowdsourcing task, a poll, group brainstorming, etc. Please mimimize the amount of one-way lecturing to students. Surprisingly, designing for interactivity requires more time, thought, and effort than preparing a one-way lecture. So please plan ahead and talk to the course staff for feedback and help.

## Why do this?
One-way lectures are boring, and they are not the best way to learn. You learn better by teaching and engaging.

<!-- TOC --><a name="submit"></a>
## How do I submit?
Here's a timeline for a Tue (Thu) presentation:
* Fri (Tue) night: Email your **lesson plan** in PDF by 11:59pm two days before class, which would be Friday (if presenting on Tue) or Tuesday (if presenting on Thu). This is to give you enough time to iterate on your plan and get feedback or help from the course staff. Please cc all your team members in the email.
* Mon (Wed) noon: Prof sends you **feedback** on the lesson plan.
* Mon (Wed) night: Send your **(tentative) slides** by 11:59pm the night before your presentation. All examples and activity design should be finalized. Minor tweaks can be made until the class. This is to ensure that Prof can better sync his part of the class with the presentation.
* Right before class: Come to class early (at least 10 mins) to check your audio, video, and screen setup.
* Mon (Wed) after class: Email your **final presentation slides and activity document**, both in PDF, by 11:59pm the day of your presentation. Your slides will be posted on the course website.

## What should a lesson plan look like?
This is a high-level outline of your class. Please send it as PDF to the staff email cs473kaist@googlegroups.com. A bullet-pointed list of things to cover is fine. Keep it to maximum one page. Make sure to include an estimate of how long you plan to spend for each component. The following should be included:
* **Learning objective**: Maximum 2-3 short statements of what students will learn or achieve by the end of your class.
* **Real-life Examples**: List examples you are planning to present to class. Add a short description about what they are and what connection you are trying to make with the course topic.
* **Activity**: Design a short activity for students to practice and apply the concepts related to the topic of the class. Asking students to work in small groups (2-4) is a good idea. Be creative and innovative. Actively use physical materials (e.g., paper or post-it) as well as digital tools (e.g., Google forms for collecting responses, Google docs for collaborative document editing). A good activity asks students to generate a concrete artifact as a result. In the lesson plan, include an initial plan of your activity.

## What should I submit after the presentation?
After your presentation, please send the following to the staff email (cs473kaist@googlegroups.com): (1) a PDF file of your final slides used in class and (2) an activity document that includes the following:
* Learning objective of the activity
* Detailed instructions for running the activity, to the level someone outside of your team can replicate
* Instructions given to students during class
* Any material used for the activity: photos of physical materials or links to digital tools (or screenshots)
* Reflection: What worked well and not? What would you change to make it work better?

<!-- TOC --><a name="grading"></a>
## How is it going to be graded?
Your presentation will be graded by the course staff. Here's the grade break-down:
* **Lesson plan (10%)**: Submitted on time? How organized is the class plan? If everything goes as planned, is it going to be an engaging session?
* **Real-life Examples (20%)**: Are the examples accurately and effectively representing the class topic? Are the examples timely, interesting, creative, thought-provoking, and unique?
* **Activity (40%)**: Did you design an engaging activity that reflects the topic of class? Did students actively participate in the discussion? Were your instructions clear? Is time well-managed? Did the post-activity discussion point to the main lessons?
* **Presentation (30%)**: How well did the overall presentation go? This includes the organization, your delivery both verbally and visually, level of preparation, quality of material, fluidity of discussion, time management, and peer students' reaction.

## Extra Credit
First volunteers are often at a disadvantage. Presenters in the first two sessions will get extra credit: 10% for the first session presenters and 5% for the second session presenters.

## Team Presentation
You will be presenting in a team. You should work closely in your team to plan the 25-minute lesson. Every member should contribute to the preparation and presentation. The general expectation goes high as the number of members in a team increases, in terms of the level of preparation, coverage of the pre-class material, etc.

## Late Policy
You should be present on the day of your presentation. No late presentations are allowed.
